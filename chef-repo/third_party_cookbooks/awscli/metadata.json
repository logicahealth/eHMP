Kitchen will setup proper\nnode attributes based on these variables. See the .kitchen.yml file for information on which variables are set.\n\n```bash\nexport TEST_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=\nexport TEST_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=\nexport TEST_AWS_REGION=\nexport TEST_BUCKET=\nexport TEST_KEY=\nexport TEST_CHECKSUM=\n```\n\n#### Variables used by .kitchen.cloud.yml\nThe .kitchen.cloud.yml file is used to test within EC2. In order to use it, you must configure proper AWS security credentials\nas well as a few other settings. Take a look at .kitchen.cloud.yml to see which specific kitchen-ec2 variables are set from\nthese environment variables.\n\n```bash\nexport AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=\nexport AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=\nexport AWS_KEYPAIR_NAME=\nexport AWS_REGION=\nexport AWS_AVAILABILITY_ZONE=\nexport EC2_SSH_KEY_PATH=\nexport AWS_EC2_AMI=\nexport AWS_IAM_PROFILE=\n```\n\n### AWS Configuration\n\n#### test_get suite dependencies\nThe following items need to be setup properly in order to use the `test_get` suite.\n\n* AWS S3 Bucket containing a test file\n* AWS IAM Account with at least GetObject access to
the bucket setup in the previous step\n* AWS IAM Account API keys for the account setup in the previous step\n\n#### profile_test_get suite dependencies\nThe following items need to be setup properly in order to use the `profile_test_get` suite.\n\n* AWS S3 Bucket containing a test file\n* AWS IAM Role/Profile with at least GetObject access to the bucket setup in the previous step\n* AWS IAM Account API Keys for an account with enough access to run an EC2 instance\n\n### Executing the integration tests\nThe `test_get` suite will download the file by\nproviding the credentials configured via the environment. Those files\nwill then be verified against the checksum you set via\n`TEST_CHECKSUM`.  If the checksum does not match the downloaded file,\nthe tests will fail.\n\n__Note: kitchen-ec2 profile support is waiting for a release. If you would like to test with\nIAM profiles, you will need to build the kitchen-ec2 gem from source.__\n\nThe `profile_test_get` suite is only available when using the\nkitchen-ec2 driver. The .kitchen.cloud.yml file is configured to use\nthe kitchen-ec2 driver. To enable this file, set the\n`KITCHEN_LOCAL_YAML` environment variable to the path for the\n.kitchen.cloud.yml file.\n\n* IAM Role Documentation: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/role-usecase-ec2app.html\n* kitchen-ec2 plugin repository: https://github.com/test-kitchen/kitchen-ec2\n\nContributing\n------------\n\n1.
