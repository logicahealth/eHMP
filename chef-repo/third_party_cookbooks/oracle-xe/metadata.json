The RPM must be placed on a server that can serve it up over HTTP, and you must set the attribute `node['oracle-xe']['url']` with that URL.\n\n## Platforms\n\nOracle Express Edition 11g is only supported on:\n\n* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5\n* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6\n\nand variants (Oracle Enterprise Linux, CentOS, Scientific)\n\n# Usage\n\nInclude the default recipe in your run list after setting the URL attribute.\n\n# Attributes\n\n* `node['oracle-xe']['url']` - The URL where you've placed the Oracle 11g Express Edition RPM.\n* `node['oracle-xe']['http-port']` - The port where you want the HTTP interface to be listening.\n* `node['oracle-xe']['tnslsnr-port']` - The port where you want the TNS listener to be listening.\n* `node['oracle-xe']['oracle-password']`  - The password for the SYS and SYSTEM accounts.\n* `node['oracle-xe']['start-lsnr-on-boot']`  - Whether to start the TNS listener on bootup.\n\n# Recipes\n\nThe default recipe installs Oracle 11g Express Edition.\n\nRoadmap and Bugs\n================\n\n* Figure out why the response file doesn't actually seem to set SYS and SYSTEM passwords properly.\n* Check Ohai data before doing anything to ensure the system has sufficient resources (cores, swap, memory) before running the RPM and having Oracle's installer fail.\n\nLicense and Author\n==================\n\n- Author::     an         (<jdunn@opscode.com>)\n- Copyright:: 2013, Opscode, Inc.\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n",
